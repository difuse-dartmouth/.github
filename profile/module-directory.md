## <a href="https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/ANTH20_W22">Anthropology 20: Primate Evolution and Ecology</a>
Primate Evolution and Ecology (ANTH 20) is an introductory course in the Anthropology department which provides a broad overview of primate behavioral ecology, with a particular focus on the interactions that exist between primates and their environments and between primates themselves. These vital interactions are viewed through the lens of natural and sexual selection.  In field work with primates, there are two main methods of data collection _focal bout sampling_ and _instantaneous scan sampling_.  The purpose of the module is to have students understand the respective strengths and weaknesses of these methods.  This module is a medium length module (3 days), uses Excel as its main tool and covers data science areas of acquiring data, analyzing data, and drawing conclusions.

## <a href="https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/ASTR15_W21">Astronomy 15: Stars and the Milky Way</a>

Stars and the Milky Way is an introductory astronomy course in the Physics and Astronomy Department. It is a general introduction to astronomy and assumes no particular student background but instructors expect that about a third of students will have some python or coding background. The module aims to introduce students to the way Astrophysicists manipulate data and perform analyses with an emphasis on data visualization and plot interpretation. Students use a sequence of python notebooks to explore, analyze astronomical data. This module uses python notebooks as its main tool and engages students in data analysis, visualization, and drawing conclusions.

## <a href="https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/EARS6_S20">Earth Sciences 6: Environmental Change</a>

Environmental Change (EARS 6) is an introductory course in Earth Sciences where students explore the factors that impact environmental change and their consequences. The module provides students with the opportunity to collect and analyze their own data as well as analyze publicly available climate and solar data sources. Students collect and analyze solar incidence angles over time to evaluate their own hypotheses, coupling this with the additional data analysis to draw conclusions about environmental change. This module uses excel as its main tool and engages students in data collection, analysis, visualization, and drawing conclusions.

## <a href="https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/EEE-350_F22">Electrical Engineering 350: Random Signal Analysis</a>

Random Signal Analysis introduces the concepts of probability and random signals with application to problems in engineering. As many of the students in the class are interested in careers in aerospace, the module focuses on airline data and appications to decision making in the airline industry. In the first part of the module, students engage in exploratory data analysis using univariate and bivariate analyses to generate hypotheses about factors that contribute to flight delays. In the second part, students assume the role of a consultant employed by Phoenix Sky Harbor airport to investigate the role of delays in the performance of airlines. At the end of Part 2, students make an informed recommendation for Sky Harbor based on the output of various machine learning models they implement. The module uses MATLAB as a platform and covers the data science topics of analyzing data, visualizing data, drawing conclusions, and communicating data.

## <a href="https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/ENGS-20_21X">Engineering 20: Introduction to Scientific Computing</a>

Introduction to Scientific Computing (ENGS 20) is a course that introduces students to programming in C and MATLAB as well as the foundations of scientific computing. This module is focussed on the MATLAB portion of the class. USING MATLAB, in this module students address questions about a model of the relationship between glucose and insulin in humans. To do so, students explore the use of numerical solvers for ODE and systems of ODE, both by coding Euler’s method ‘by hand’ as well as by using built-in solvers. Students use published data to fit parameters of a model and make predictions with the numerical solutions. The module covers data science areas of analyzing data, visualizing data, and drawing conclusions.

## <a href="https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/GEOG36_F20">Geography 36: Climate Extremes on a Warming Planet</a>

Climate Extremes On A Warming Planet looks at drought, famine, floods, landslides and other extreme weather events through the lens of climate change. Students do some coding in python to facilitate analysis and understanding of climate data sets that relate to extreme events. Before this module, the course had a series of python tutorials for students but the examples were not related to the course. This module redesigned the python notebooks to teach coding through manipulation and analysis of climate data sets, linking to course topics as the term progressed. The module covers data science areas of analyzing data, visualizing data, and drawing conclusions.

## <a href="https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/SOCY34_F21">Sociology 34: Health Disparities</a>

Health Disparities (Sociology 34) explores the interrelations between health outcomes and key socialogical concepts such as race, wealth, gender, and other social determinants of health. This module provides a portal for students to explore these data easily both visually and statistically. The four components help students explore relationships between health outcomes and different social determinants of health in the State of Texas through visualizations of bivariate data that allow them to generate and/or test hypotheses. This is coupled with a regression tool that allows a deeper statistical interrogation. The module covers data science areas of analyzing data, visualizing data, drawing conclusions, and communicating data.
