## Anthropology 6: Introduction to Biological Anthropology 

## Earth Sciences 6: Environmental Change

Environmental Change (EARS 6) is an introductory course in Earth Sciences where students explore the factors that impact environmental change and their consequences. The module provides students with the opportunity to collect and analyze their own data as well as analyze publicly available climate and solar data sources. Students collect and analyze solar incidence angles over time to evaluate their own hypotheses, coupling this with the additional data analysis to draw conclusions about environmental change. This module uses excel as its main tool and engages students in data collection, analysis, visualization, and drawing conclusions.

## Engineering 20: Introduction to Scientific Computing

Introduction to Scientific Computing (ENGS 20) is a course that introduces students to programming in C and MATLAB as well as the foundations of scientific computing. This module is focussed on the MATLAB portion of the class. USING MATLAB, in this module students address questions about a model of the relationship between glucose and insulin in humans. To do so, students explore the use of numerical solvers for ODE and systems of ODE, both by coding Euler’s method ‘by hand’ as well as by using built-in solvers. Students use published data to fit parameters of a model and make predictions with the numerical solutions. The module covers data science areas of analyzing data, visualizing data, and drawing conclusions.

## <a href="https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/SOCY34_F21">Sociology 34: Health Disparities</a>

Health Disparities (Sociology 34) explores the interrelations between health outcomes and key socialogical concepts such as race, wealth, gender, and other social determinants of health. This module provides a portal for students to explore these data easily both visually and statistically. The four components help students explore relationships between health outcomes and different social determinants of health in the State of Texas through visualizations of bivariate data that allow them to generate and/or test hypotheses. This is coupled with a regression tool that allows a deeper statistical interrogation. The module covers data science areas of analyzing data, visualizing data, drawing conclusions, and communicating data.
