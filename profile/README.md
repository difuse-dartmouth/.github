# About DIFUSE <a href="#Top"><img src="https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/.github/blob/main/profile/images/backtotop.png" alt="BacktoTop" style="height:40px" align="right"/></a>

DIFUSE is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded project (NSF IUSE-1917002) at <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth College</a> aimed at creating opportunities for undergraduates to learn and use data science in introductory STEM courses and beyond.  We work with undergraduates, PhD students, and faculty to develop data science "modules” to integrate into course curriculum. <i> We define modules as assignments, or a series of exercises, that use principles of data science to teach a concept relevant to the course. </i> We also provide opportunites to undergraduate and PhD students to apply data science and data visualization through internships and work in the <a href="https://dali.dartmouth.edu">DALI Lab</a>. The aim of the DIFUSE project is to help integrate data science modules into introductory STEM and social science curricula at Dartmouth College.

To evaluate the impact of the modules and our work, we have developed a [Survey of Attitudes towards Data Science](https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/Survey-of-Attitudes-towards-Data-Science) and host data and [other research materials related to the project](https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/difuse-research).

When you open a link to a repository you will see something like the image below, which comes from a template we use for all of our module repositories. At the top you'll see a directory with subfolders and files.  But the most important thing is the "README" file that is shown below.

<img src="https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/.github/blob/main/profile/images/difuse-module-structure-new.png" alt="Sample opening page for a DIFUSE module." width="800pt" align="center"/>

This README contains a more complete summary of the module, identifying the instructor and the course it was originally designed for. Other images included are the creative commons license, a download link, and module badge. Finally, the README describes the module's objectives, expectations from students, and a class schedule with links to specific module components.

## Module Badge
The module badge on the splash image is a visual representation of the contents and scope of the module. It highlights
- the type of computational tools used in the module (e.g. Excel, Python, R, MATLAB, Google tools), and 
- the data science content the module covers
