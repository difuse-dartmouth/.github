# About DIFUSE <a href="https://github.com/MunaOnuoha/pagestest/edit/main/README.md#Top"><img src="backtotop.png" alt="About DIFUSE" style="height:40px" align="right"/></a>

DIFUSE is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded project (NSF IUSE-1917002) at <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth College</a> aimed at creating opportunities for undergraduates to learn and use data science in introductory STEM courses and beyond.  We work with undergraduates, PhD students, and faculty to develop data science "modules” to integrate into course curriculum.  We offer opportunities for undergraduate and PhD students to apply data science and data visualization through Internships and work in the <a href="https://dali.dartmouth.edu">DALI Lab</a>.  The aim of the DIFUSE project is to help integrate data science modules into introductory STEM and social science curriculum at Dartmouth College.

# Inside a Module's Repo <a href="https://github.com/MunaOnuoha/pagestest/edit/main/README.md#Top"><img src="backtotop.png" alt="About DIFUSE" style="height:40px" align="right"/></a>

When you open a link to a repository you will see something like the image below, which comes from a template we use for all of our module repositories.

<img src="https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/.github/blob/6f2c62ac71f4767c64f667573d72e30509fcd18e/profile/images/DIFUSE-sample-page.png" alt="Sample opening page for a DIFUSE module." style="height:600px" align="center"/>

At the top you'll see a directory with subfolders and files.  But the most important thing is the "README" file that is shown below.  The image identifies the project, the instructor, and the course the module is for.  Scrolling down, you'll see a brief module description, the creative commons license that applies to the module, a badge, and a link to the module materials.

---------
## Badges indicate module features <a href="https://youtu.be/CyeeeJSTGis" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/.github/blob/3a381be0690f4be76126c41f628749ced7f3fea0/profile/images/walkthrough-badges-icon.png" style="width:2in" alt="Play badges video" align="left"></a>

As you explore these modules, we have tried to provide quick information to allow you to assess the contents and scope of the module so you can focus on the ones that are most salient to your goals. For each module we provide a visual indication of these variables that include:
- The type of computational tools used in the module (e.g. Excel, Python, R, MATLAB, Google tools)
- What is the level of the course that the module was designed for (Introductory, Mid-level, Advanced)
- The length of the module (short, medium, or long)
- The data science content the module covers

For the last item, we identified six areas of data science that we use to label projects:  acquiring data, managing data, analyzing data, visualizing data, drawing conclusions, and communicating data.

![Six components of data science: acquiring data, managing data, analyzing data, visualizing data, drawing conclusions, and communicating data](https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/.github/blob/9346468ec1def29edfb2ba51cd1ef8748b918f2f/profile/images/DS-areas_75.png "Six components of data science: acquiring data, managing data, analyzing data, visualizing data, drawing conclusions, and communicating data")

The visual "badge" is based off of the following template:


![Visual badge template](https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/.github/blob/528cbcef6c736e04f2f6281a3ad9ed03ea62db87/profile/images/badge-template_50.png "Visual badge template")


In the circle to the left you will find an icon representing the tool used, the next grey bar shows the level of the course, and the next indicates the time required by the student -  one dark grey bar is a short amount of time, two is moderate, and three is long.  The remaining pieces of the chain are indications of the six data science areas.  For a given module, the areas that are _not_ covered have the color removed, leaving the ones covered visible.  

For example, here is the badge for the module in Introduction to Scientific Computing:


![Medium length module for an introductory course using MATLAB and covering analyzing, visualizing data and drawing conclusions.](https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/.github/blob/528cbcef6c736e04f2f6281a3ad9ed03ea62db87/profile/images/ENGS_20_badge_50.png "Medium length module for an introductory course using MATLAB and covering analyzing, visualizing data and drawing conclusions.")

The tool circle shows the icon for MATLAB, the bolded text in the next block indicates the course is introductory, and the two dark grey bars indicate the student time commitment is moderate.  The data science areas of analyzing data, visualizing data, and drawing conclusions are covered in the module as indicated by the colored blocks while the other areas are not covered as they have been made transparent.

## Module materials page <a href="https://youtu.be/5BbLNQKHWwk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/.github/blob/3c958c86ba876025eb5e3109933014e0276d81d6/profile/images/walkthrough-materials-icon.png" alt="Play the module materials page video" style="width:2in" align="left"></a>

Clicking the module materials link takes you to a different README file in the _completed_module_ subdirectory.  For each module, you will see several sections.
### Primary Objectives
This section gives the top level objectives for the module in the context of the rest of the course.
### Student expectations
Here we briefly describe what the instructors can expect of the students.  For example, what background are students likely to have? have they taken prerequisite courses?  Is the course mostly first-year students or a mixture of years?
### Learning Objectives
Each module has a set of learning objectives which we list here.
### Module outline and calendar
This section gives a sense of how the module was initially deployed and details when different items happen, how much time students have to complete them, and other details.

## Investigators

### Petra Bonfert-Taylor: Principal Investigator

Petra is a professor of engineering and associate dean for diversity and inclusion at Dartmouth College. She teaches Introduction to Scientific Computing and Embedded Systems in the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth. Her research interests include complex analysis, geometric function theory, discrete groups, complex dynamics, and mathematics of medical imaging. 

### Lorie Loeb: Principal Investigator

Lorie is the faculty director of DALI Lab and director of the Digital Arts Program (MS and Undergraduate) at Dartmouth College. Her work is about creating well-designed technology tools that change the way people think and behave. Her research focuses on effective methods for presenting and visualizing information in order to get people’s attention, communicate effectively, and change behavior. The DALI Lab is an innovation and leadership "garage" where students from all over campus come together in small teams to work on big problems. 

### Scott Pauls: Principal Investigator

Scott is the chair of the department of mathematics and director of the Dartmouth Center for the Advancement of Learning (DCAL). Professor Pauls' research in mathematics focuses on building and analyzing network models for social, biological, and physical systems. In his theoretical work, he aims to find network theoretic signatures for outcomes of dynamical processes. Recently, he has been able to apply these techniques to systems in political science, economics, neuroscience, and environmental science.

### Laura Ray: Principal Investigator

Laura is a professor of engineering and senior associate dean of faculty development at Dartmouth College. She teaches Introduction to Control Theory, Mechatronics, and Responsible & Ethical Conduct of Research in the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth. Her research interests include system dynamics and controls, robotics, signal processing, and machine intelligence.
