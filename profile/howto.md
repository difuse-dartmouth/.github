# How to use the dartmouth-difuse collection of repositories

This set of repositories consists of more than a dozen modules that introduce some aspect(s) of data science into different courses.  The broad aim of all the modules is to stimulate interest in data science in students and to expose them to how data science can be used in different fields.  As you explore these modules, we have tried to provide quick information to allow you to assess the contents and scope of the module so you can focus on the ones that are most salient to your goals. For each module we provide a visual indication of these variables that include:
- The type of computational tools used in the module (e.g. Excel, Python, R, MATLAB, Google tools)
- What is the level of the course that the module was designed for (Introductory, Mid-level, Advanced)
- The length of the module (short, medium, or long)
- The data science content the module covers

For the last item, we identified six areas of data science that we use to label projects:  aquiring data, managing data, analyzing data, visualizing data, drawing conclusions, and communicating data.

![Six components of data science: aquiring data, managing data, analyzing data, visualizing data, drawing conclusions, and communicating data](https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/.github/blob/de58bc3aa85e7b75b0e04d022582e4743e15508c/profile/DS-areas.png "Six components of data science: aquiring data, managing data, analyzing data, visualizing data, drawing conclusions, and communicating data")

The visual "badge" is based off of the following template:

In the circle to the left you will find an icon representing the tool used, the next grey bar shows the level of the course, and the next indicates the time required by the student -  one dark grey bar is a short amount of time, two is moderate, and three is long.  The remaining pieces of the chain are indications of the six data science areas.  For a given module, the areas that are _not_ covered have the color removed, leaving the ones covered visible.  

For example, here is the badge for the module in Introduction to Scientific Computing:
![Medium length module for an introductory course using MATLAB and covering analyzing, visualizing data and drawing conclusions.](https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/21X_ENGS20/blob/aa4dccf2b03d445d37adeee735e9dfb280473103/ENGS%2020%20badge.png "Medium length module for an introductory course using MATLAB and covering analyzing, visualizing data and drawing conclusions.")

The tool circle shows the icon for MATLAB, the bolded text in the next block indicates the course is introductory, and the two dark grey bars indicate the student time commitment is moderate.  The data science areas of analyzing data, visualizing data, and drawing conclusions are covered in the module as indicated by the colored blocks while the other areas are not covered as they have been made transparent.
