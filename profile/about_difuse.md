# About DIFUSE

## Overview

DIFUSE is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded project (NSF IUSE-1917002) at <a href="www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth College</a> aimed at creating opportunities for undergraduates to learn and use data science in introductory STEM courses and beyond.  We work with undergraduates, PhD students, and faculty to develop data science "modules” to integrate into course curriculum.  We offer opportunities for undergraduate and PhD students to apply data science and data visualization through Internships and work in the <a href="dali.dartmouth.edu">DALI Lab</a>.  The aim of the DIFUSE project is to help integrate data science modules into introductory STEM and social science curriculum at Dartmouth College.

## Investigators

### Petra Bonfert-Taylor: Principal Investigator

Petra is a professor of engineering and associate dean for diversity and inclusion at Dartmouth College. She teaches Introduction to Scientific Computing and Embedded Systems in the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth. Her research interests include complex analysis, geometric function theory, discrete groups, complex dynamics, and mathematics of medical imaging. 

### Lorie Loeb: Principal Investigator

Lorie is the faculty director of DALI Lab and director of the Digital Arts Program (MS and Undergraduate) at Dartmouth College. Her work is about creating well-designed technology tools that change the way people think and behave. Her research focuses on effective methods for presenting and visualizing information in order to get people’s attention, communicate effectively, and change behavior. The DALI Lab is an innovation and leadership "garage" where students from all over campus come together in small teams to work on big problems. 

### Scott Pauls: Principal Investigator

Scott is the chair of the department of mathematics and director of the Dartmouth Center for the Advancement of Learning (DCAL). Professor Pauls' research in mathematics focuses on building and analyzing network models for social, biological, and physical systems. In his theoretical work, he aims to find network theoretic signatures for outcomes of dynamical processes. Recently, he has been able to apply these techniques to systems in political science, economics, neuroscience, and environmental science.

### Laura Ray: Principal Investigator

Laura is a professor of engineering and senior associate dean of faculty development at Dartmouth College. She teaches Introduction to Control Theory, Mechatronics, and Responsible & Ethical Conduct of Research in the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth. Her research interests include system dynamics and controls, robotics, signal processing, and machine intelligence.
